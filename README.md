# ICSparser
Given a .ics file from canvas, prints out the course, name of assignment, and then the date it is due, in a csv file's format. Contains a hashmap to convert course name into something readable (ex: [202410-PHYS 2101 Leilabady-XLS2090202410_Combined] --> PHYS-2101) Things to do: make the hashmap modular and upload to sheets..
